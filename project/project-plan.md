# Project Plan

## Title
Exploring the Interplay Between Climate Change indicators and Air Pollution levels in United States during the years 2010-2020


## Main Question
1. How have tempreature and air pollution levels changes over the years?
2. Is there a correlation between key air pollutant levels (PM10, PM2.5, NO2) and climate change indicators?


## Description

Climate change and air pollution, both products of human activity, represent urgent global challenges. Climate change brings rising temperatures, altered weather patterns, and increased extreme events, threatening ecosystems and human well-being. Meanwhile, air pollution, stemming from industrial processes and transportation, poses significant health risks and ecological harm.
In light of these intertwined challenges, this project seeks to explore the correlation between climate change and air pollution. By unraveling the complex interplay between these critical environmental factors, we aim to inform evidence-based strategies for mitigating their adverse impacts on human health, ecosystems, and the planet's resilience.
