## Title
Exploring the Interplay Between Climate Change and Air Pollution: A Data-driven Analysis


## Main Question

1. Is there any asscociation between climate change and air pollution? 


## Description

Climate change and air pollution, both products of human activity, represent urgent global challenges. Climate change brings rising temperatures, altered weather patterns, and increased extreme events, threatening ecosystems and human well-being. Meanwhile, air pollution, stemming from industrial processes and transportation, poses significant health risks and ecological harm.
In light of these intertwined challenges, this project seeks to explore the correlation between climate change and air pollution. By unraveling the complex interplay between these critical environmental factors, we aim to inform evidence-based strategies for mitigating their adverse impacts on human health, ecosystems, and the planet's resilience.
